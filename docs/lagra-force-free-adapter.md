# Lagra force-free adapter note

This change records the pde-engine side of Lagra's external force-free
adapter gate.

## What changed in pde-engine

- `problems/force_free/validator.py` now keys validator-cache entries by the
  expression and the validation context: schema, `Omega`, `check_regularity`,
  `fast_point_only`, and `use_lean`.
- The fast point mode no longer uses a second-derivative placeholder shortcut.
  It builds the exact symbolic determinant and stops after the exact paper
  point check. The determinant uses `L_T(A)`, `L_T(B)`, `L_T^2(A)`, and
  `L_T^2(B)`, so the shortcut was under-specified.
- `general_method_paper_reproduction.py` now imports `problems.load_problem`
  from the repository package namespace inside spawned worker processes, with
  a local fallback import for `PreciseFoliationValidator`.
- `tests/test_force_free_validator_cache.py` proves the cache separates
  rotation context: `rho**2*exp(-2*z)` is valid at `Omega=0`, invalid at
  `Omega=1`, and those two validations receive different cache hashes even
  when they share the same cache database.

## How Lagra used pde-engine

Lagra used pde-engine as an external operator and registry boundary, not as an
internal source of truth.

The Lagra gate
`experiments/proof-search/pde_engine_force_free_point_gate.py` imports the
local pde-engine force-free symbols and loads the seven known force-free
foliations from the pde-engine problem registry. Lagra then evaluates the
force-free determinant

```text
det([[L_T(A), L_T(B)], [L_T^2(A), L_T^2(B)]])
```

with its own exact SymPy adapter and records the result into its proof-search
artifact catalog. The current gate result is:

- `7/7` registry solutions simplify to exact symbolic determinant `0`.
- `2/2` false controls simplify to exact nonzero determinants:
  `rho*z -> 16*rho*z` and `exp(rho*z) -> 16*rho*z*exp(6*rho*z)`.
- The same expressions pass three high-precision rational checkpoint tests:
  known solutions remain below `1e-60`, while false controls exceed `1e-6`.
- The upstream validator accepts three bounded non-rotating controls.
- The rotation-context regression proves `rho**2*exp(-2*z)` is valid at
  `Omega=0`, invalid at `Omega=1`, and has rotating determinant
  `2048*rho**9*exp(-12*z)`.

Lagra binds those results into its `.lagra` proof-search constants and checks
them through publication-readiness and integrity gates before the result is
allowed into the rendered paper.

## Claim boundary

This is a positive pde-engine adapter, exact symbolic determinant check, point
check, and validator-cache regression. It is not a Lean proof. It is not a
full pde-engine reproduction claim. It is not a claim that the parallel
discovery path is green.

The Lagra health gate still records the broader pde-engine reproduction path
as not fully reproduced on the local checkout used for this paper. After the
second patch, the bounded depth-2 smoke no longer hits the old
`PreciseFoliationValidator` worker `NameError`, no longer fails the Lean build,
and no longer times out under the 20 second health wrapper. It exits with
return code `0`, generates `112` expressions, reports `76` valid rows, and finds
`2` known vertical canonical forms. That is a process-clean smoke, not a full
seven-solution Compere reproduction.

These are pde-engine-facing paper artifacts generated on 2026-05-26 in the
visual style of `/Users/p/Downloads/LagraPaperV1 (1).pdf`. The paper maps the
seven diagrams in that reference paper onto the pde-engine force-free adapter:
pipeline, vocabulary chips, graph anatomy, data flow, exploded kernel, verifier
triangle, and derivation-style cache regression. Each diagram states what
enters Lagra and what measurement comes out.
